# Taplicate
A game that kills time and develop reflections. It reaches nearly 1000 downloads in the first month. You can download from Google Store and play it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HungVu.Taplicate). There was a version on Appstore, but I already took it down  because my Apple Developer account is expired

## Installing
Install [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), I developed this game using Unity3D. Unity, in my opinion, is the best tool to develop games from mobile to PC. There is [free](https://store.unity.com/products/unity-personal) version for personal purposes.


## Project structure
The actual **C#** code and asset is the **Asset** folder:
* `Fonts, SFX, Textures, Logo` contains media that is used to build the game
* `_Scences` contains *.unity* files that set up the scene for each part of the game
* `Scripts` contains *.cs* files that defines the behavior of each scene in the game. For example, *ClassicController.cs* determines the normal mode, or *TimeAttackController.cs* determines that game mode that has only 30 seconds
